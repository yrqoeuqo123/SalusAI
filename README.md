## Code Contribution and Conflict Resolution

Before committing code, ensure there are no conflicts or potential issues. Follow these steps:

1. **Check for Conflicts**: Always pull the latest changes from the base branch and check for conflicts.

2. **Collaboration**: If you encounter problems, reach out to the team in the group chat for a review.

3. **Unresolved Issues**: For problems that remain unsolved, prepare a concise description and bring it up in the next meeting.

**Branch Naming Criteria**: Adhere to the specified branch naming criteria (`feature/`, `bugfix/`, `hotfix/`, etc.) for clarity and consistency in our workflow.

## Branch Management

In SalusAI, we adhere to specific branch management rules to ensure a smooth and efficient workflow:

1. **Feature Branches (`feature/<feature-name>`):** Used for developing new features. Branched from and merged back into `develop`.

2. **Bugfix Branches (`bugfix/<bugfix-description>`):** For bug fixes, usually branched from and merged back into `develop`.

3. **Hotfix Branches (`hotfix/<hotfix-description>`):** For urgent fixes to production, branched from `main` and merged back into both `main` and `develop`.

4. **Release Branches (`release/<release-version>`):** For preparing releases, branched from `develop` and merged into `main` and back into `develop`.

5. **Experiment Branches (`experiment/<experiment-name>`):** For experimental work, not necessarily merged back.

These rules help maintain order and clarity in our version control system.
